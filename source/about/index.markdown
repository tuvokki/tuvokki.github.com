My name and nickname and some other information few people care about.
Wouter, @tuvokki and programmer and general technology enthousiast.

Professional JAVA Software Engineer, Python enthousiast. Working with Django feels like a breeze. Also toying around with Play!Framework makes my heart go faster. It is still hard to get out of the POC-phse, uy hey, who cares? As long as we have fun.

Bye now.
