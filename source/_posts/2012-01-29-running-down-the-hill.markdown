As time goes by and thoughts materialize into memories written in code, some new stuff surfaces to various repositories. I tend to do things and never reflect on them. Never improve the code and only research until the proof of conceptphase is done. After that nothing happens.

#### Next item on the list is a todo-list that describes things to do on the list.
* Create a decent todo-list app
	1. Enable users to add todo's into the list for a specific app
	2. add categories to the todo's
	3. automatically delete all bugs from the list with 'cannot reproduce' as reason
* poolratings: ELO based system for ranking players in an ongoing pool tournament at work.
	1. add the possibility to delete or disable players
	2. set winner on create game
* picture-project: convert a (set of) directories with pictures into a website showing them.
	1. add tempting system
	2. make settings and integrate them in templates

New entry in the list is a fork that creates a Django app. Lovely.

To work now.
