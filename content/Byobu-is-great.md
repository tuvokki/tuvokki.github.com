I recently switched from good 'ol GNU Screen to the more flexible [Byobu](http://byobu.co/). Nice, versatile and handy, but also clumsy in the beginning beacuse I have to unlearn all my standard keystrokes to do stuff and learn new ones. Here's a list to refer to when I'm stuck.

### KEYBINDINGS

byobu keybindings can be user defined in /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/ (or within .screenrc if byobu-export was used).

The  common  key  bindings are:

Key|Action
---|------
F2 | Create a new window
F3 | Move to previous window
F4 | Move to next window
F5 | Reload profile
F6 | Detach from this session
F7 | Enter copy/scrollback mode
F8 | Re-title a window
F9 | Configuration Menu
F12 |  Lock this terminal
shift-F2 | Split the screen horizontally
ctrl-F2 | Split the screen vertically
shift-F3 | Shift the focus to the previous split region
shift-F4 | Shift the focus to the next split region
shift-F5 | Join all splits
ctrl-F6 | Remove this split
ctrl-F5 | Reconnect GPG and SSH sockets
shift-F6 | Detach, but do not logout
alt-pgup | Enter scrollback mode
alt-pgdn | Enter scrollback mode
Ctrl-a $ | show detailed status
Ctrl-a R | Reload profile
Ctrl-a ! | Toggle key bindings on and off
Ctrl-a k | Kill the current window
Ctrl-a ~ | Save the current window's scrollback buffer

### SCROLLBACK, COPY, PASTE MODES

Each window in Byobu has up to 10,000 lines of scrollback history, which you can enter and navigate using the alt-pgup and alt-pgdn keys.Exit scrollback mode by hitting enter. 

You can also easily copy and paste text from scrollback mode. To do so, enter scrollback using alt-pgup or alt-pgdn, press the spacebar to start highlighting text, use up/down/left/right/pgup/pgdn to select the text, and press enter to copy the text. You can then paste the text using alt-insert or ctrl-a-].
