39 (thirty-nine) is the natural number following 38 and preceding 40.

Thirty-nine is the sum of consecutive primes `(3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13)` and also is the product of the first and the last of those consecutive primes. Among small semiprimes only three other integers `(10, 155, and 371)` share this attribute. 39 also is the sum of the first three powers of 3 `(3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3)`. Given 39, the Mertens function returns 0.

39 is the smallest natural number which has three partitions into three parts which all give the same product when multiplied: `{25, 8, 6}`, `{24, 10, 5}`, `{20, 15, 4}`.

39 is the 12th distinct semiprime and the 4th in the `{3.q} family`. It is the last member of the third distinct biprime pair `(38,39)`.

39 has an aliquot sum of 17 which is itself a prime. 39 is the 4th member of the 17-aliquot tree. It is a Perfect totient number

The thirteenth Perrin number is 39, which comes after 17, 22, 29 (it is the sum of the first two mentioned).

Since the greatest prime factor of `392 + 1 = 1522` is `761`, which is obviously more than 39 twice, 39 is a St√∏rmer number.

The F26A graph is a symmetric graph with 39 edges.
