I actually added some content to this blog. Nothing worth mentioning, so if you stumbled across this post by accident you don't have to bother reading the other posts.

A few things have changed. Maybe it would look nice to have something of an archive.

I switched to the markdown editor [Mou](http://mouapp.com/ "Pretty great editor for markdown files"). "Mou The missing Markdown editor for web developers". A brilliant editor that shows your markdown text on the left-hand side and the actual wysiwyg on the right.

Furthermore I switched to using [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/ "GitHub for Mac"). As they say themselves:
> At GitHub, we think that sharing code should be as simple as possible.
##### Thatâ€™s why we created GitHub for Mac.

There is a marvelous button with a nice Apple-logo and the message 'Clone in Mac' at the top of any github-repository which automatically links to this application. I can manage my own repositories on my local disk without hassle and as a mac-user I love a good graphical interface.

Next? Some actual productivity? Who knows? :)

For now I'll just close with:
	rake generate && rake deploy
