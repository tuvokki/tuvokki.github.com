title: What I didn't tell you

So this is just a test. But as tests go by it can always evolve into something useful.

I managed to get the template as boring as they get, using only grey as 'color', with a nice list of repositories on the side an a tweet button below the posts. Also I list my recent tweets here. 

Brilliant and simple.

Now what to do? Just post a nice quote from Moby Dik here:

    Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
