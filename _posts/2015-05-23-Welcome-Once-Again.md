title: Welcome once Again

So, this is what I wrote some time ago. Noone ever read it, even I forgot about it minutes after writing it. Furthermore, most of the things written here are not valid anymore.

I still haven't created a decent to-do-list app. The tournamentsoftware hit production at some point in time, but never really took off. And the picture project was a solution for a niche that never existed.

####Anyway, here's the post of JAN 26TH, 2012

As time goes by and thoughts materialize into memories written in code, some new stuff surfaces to various repositories. I tend to do things and never reflect on them. Never improve the code and only research until the proof-of-concept phase is done. After that nothing happens.

#### Next item on the list is a todo-list that describes things to do on the list.

*   Create a decent todo-list app
    1.  Enable users to add todo’s into the list for a specific app
    2.  add categories to the todo’s
    3.  automatically delete all bugs from the list with ‘cannot reproduce’ as reason
*   poolratings: ELO based system for ranking players in an ongoing pool tournament at work.
    1.  add the possibility to delete or disable players
    2.  set winner on create game
*   picture-project: convert a (set of) directories with pictures into a website showing them.
    1.  add tempting system
    2.  make settings and integrate them in templates

New entry in the list is a fork that creates a Django app. Lovely.

To work now.

####So, what's new this time?

Well, not new, but still going strong, is the intention to blog. This is an ongoing process, going on right now. But what else?

Let's see. Three projects that are worth mentioning.

[Huna_Server](https://github.com/TuvokVersatileKolinahr/Huna_Server)
hunaJS takes care of your errors. This project is done with my mate [Elger](https://github.com/elgervb). An initiative to provide developers with a system to track clientside errors in webapps.

[gitcontrol](https://github.com/tuvokki/gitcontrol)
Provide some control over the git repos on a server without commandline access to it, created to control git-repo's without having to create users on your production systems. Just a website with a button.

[data-api](https://github.com/tuvokki/data-api)
An API implementation usng PyMongo, Flask and Flask-Classy. A basic data api, now filled with the philosophical proverbs of Erik van W.

####Enough to do

A nice bunch of things in stock. Coding is still passion, some things never change.
