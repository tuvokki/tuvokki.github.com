All unix terminals have a feature from way back when a [terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter) was a piece of hardware connected to the computer via a serial port. The terminal could send [flow control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control#Transmit_flow_control) commands to the computer: [“XON”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XON/XOFF) (meaning “stop sending me stuff, I'm not ready”) and [“XOFF”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XON/XOFF) (meaning “ok, throw me what you've got”). I normally recommend turning these features off in your terminal configuration (the command is [`stty -ixon`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stty)), but in this particular case, they're useful: press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to stop scrolling, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> to resume.
