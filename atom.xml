    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few things have changed. I actually added some content to this blog. Nothing worth mentioning, so if you stumbled across this post by accident you don&#8217;t have to bother reading the other posts, but it looks nice to have something of an archive.</p>

<p>I switched to the markdown editor <a href="http://mouapp.com/" title="Pretty great editor for markdown files">Mou</a>. &#8220;Mou The missing Markdown editor for web developers&#8221;. A brilliant editor that shows your markdown text on the left-hand side and the actual wysiwyg on the right.</p>

<p>Furthermore I switched to using <a href="http://mac.github.com/" title="GitHub for Mac">GitHub for Mac</a>. As they say themselves:</p>

<blockquote><p>At GitHub, we think that sharing code should be as simple as possible.</p>

<h5>Thatâ€™s why we created GitHub for Mac.</h5></blockquote>

<p>There is a marvelous button with a nice Apple-logo and the message &#8216;Clone in Mac&#8217; at the top of any github-repository which automatically links to this application. I can manage my own repositories on my local disk without hassle and as a mac-user I love a good graphical interface.</p>

<p>Next? Some actual productivity? Who knows? :)</p>

<p>For now I&#8217;ll just close with:</p>

<pre><code>rake generate &amp;&amp; rake deploy
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As time goes by and thoughts materialize into memories written in code, some new stuff surfaces to various repositories. I tend to do things and never reflect on them. Never improve the code and only research until the proof of conceptphase is done. After that nothing happens.</p>

<h4>Next item on the list is a todo-list that describes things to do on the list.</h4>

<ul>
<li>Create a decent todo-list app

<ol>
<li>Enable users to add todo&#8217;s into the list for a specific app</li>
<li>add categories to the todo&#8217;s</li>
<li>automatically delete all bugs from the list with &#8216;cannot reproduce&#8217; as reason</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>poolratings: ELO based system for ranking players in an ongoing pool tournament at work.

<ol>
<li>add the possibility to delete or disable players</li>
<li>set winner on create game</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>picture-project: convert a (set of) directories with pictures into a website showing them.

<ol>
<li>add tempting system</li>
<li>make settings and integrate them in templates</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>New entry in the list is a fork that creates a Django app. Lovely.</p>

<p>To work now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So this is just a test. But as tests go by it can always evolve into something useful.</p>

<p>I managed to get the template as boring as they get, using only grey as &#8216;color&#8217;, with a nice list of repositories on the side an a tweet button below the posts. Also I list my recent tweets here.</p>

<p>Brilliant and simple.</p>

<p>Now what to do? Just post a nice quote from Moby Dik here:</p>

<pre><code>Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is no way of telling why I do this every time. This must be CMS/Blogging system number 100 or more I have tried. Maybe I should do something with that passion. Anyway, I have installed Octopress and I am writing my first blog right now.</p>

<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>Using markdown is easy for a hacker like me. Also I like to edit my fies in vim, zo using this via the command-line is really easy.</p>

<h2>Enough</h2>

<h3>lets post!</h3>

<p>Bye now.</p>
