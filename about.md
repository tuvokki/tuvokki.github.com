There is no way of telling why I do this every time. This must be CMS/Blogging system number 100 or more I have tried. Maybe I should do something with that passion. Anyway, I have configured [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) and I have been blogging in it since 2012 (allright, with a gap between 2012 and 2015, but who's complaining?)

###Enough
Just browse the posts and maybe get in contact if you like (or dislike) anything.

`Bye now.`
